            </div>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The myFlix application was designed as a movie web app, utilizing the MERN stack to create both a
              server-side REST API and a client-side Single Page Application (SPA). The goal
              of
              the project was to provide users with seamless access information about movies, manage personal profiles,
              and
              curate their own list of favorite movies, all within a responsive, intuitive user interface.
            </p>
            <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
            <p>myFlix is a personal project I created to demonstrate my abilities in full-stack JavaScript development.

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The primary challenge was to create a fully functional, user-friendly web application that would interact
              with a server-side API to manage movie data and user accounts. <b>The key
                objectives were:</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Develop a RESTful API to handle data related to movies, genres, and directors.</li>
              <li>Build a responsive and dynamic front-end interface using React.</li>
              <li>Implement user authentication and authorization.</li>
              <li>Ensure the application was deployed and accessible online.</li>

            <h3>1. Server-Side Development</h3>
            <p><b>Database Design:</b> Using MongoDB, I defined the data models for movies, genres, directors, and
              users.
              Mongoose was employed to create schemas and enforce data validation.</p>
            <p><b>API Development:</b> I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. This API included endpoints
              for
              retrieving movie information, managing user accounts, and handling user authentication. Key features
              included:
            <ul>
              <li><b>User Management:</b> Endpoints for user registration, login, updating profiles, and deregistration.
              </li>
              <li><b>Movie Management:</b> Endpoints for retrieving movie details, genres, and director information.
              </li>
              <li><b>Favorites Management:</b> Endpoints for users to add and remove movies from their favorite list.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b>Authentication:</b> Implemented JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints. User passwords
              were
              hashed using Bcrypt to ensure security.</p>
            <p><b>Deployment:</b> The API was deployed on Heroku, with the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. I
              configured
              environmental variables to manage sensitive data securely.
            </p>

          <div class="cs-section__item">
            <h3>2. Client-Side Development</h3>
            <p><b>UI Design and Prototyping:</b> I started with wireframes and prototypes to design the user interface.
              The
              focus was on creating a clean, intuitive layout that would be easy to navigate.
            </p>
            <p><b>React Development:</b> The SPA was built using React, taking advantage of its component-based
              architecture
              to ensure modularity and reusability. React Router was used to manage client-side routing, enabling users
              to
              navigate between the login/signup views, the main movie list, and the profile page.
            </p>
            <p><b>State Management:</b> I used React's state and props to manage the application's state, ensuring that
              data
              was efficiently passed between components.
            </p>
            <p><b>Responsive Design:</b> The application was styled using React Bootstrap and custom SCSS to ensure it
              was
              fully responsive across different devices. The design was tested and refined to provide a consistent user
              experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p><b>Integration with API:</b> The client-side was integrated with the server-side API to fetch movie data,
              manage user accounts, and handle user authentication.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="cs-section">
          <div class="cs-section__item">
            <h3>3. Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <p><b>Unit Testing:</b> Individual components and functions were tested to ensure they behaved as expected.
              The
              API was tested using Postman, the client-side components were tested using mainly console logs, the IDE
              debugger, and individual interaction in the app.
            </p>
            <p><b>Integration Testing: </b> The interaction between the client-side and server-side components was
              tested
              to
              ensure smooth data flow and proper API responses.
            </p>
            <p><b>User Testing:</b> I asked several users to test the application to gather feedback on the its
              usability
              and
              performance. Based on this feedback, several UI elements were refined, and minor bugs were fixed.

          <div class="cs-section__item">
            <h3>4. Deployment</h3>
            <p>The final step was to deploy the client-side application on Netlify, making it accessible to users. I
              configured continuous deployment to automatically update the application whenever new changes were pushed
              to
              the repository.

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <div class="info-cards">
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>Handling Asynchronous Data Fetching</h3>
            <p>One of the challenges I faced was managing asynchronous data fetching, especially when multiple API calls
              were required to render a single view. To address this, I used React's useEffect hook to fetch data after
              the
              component mounted and employed conditional rendering to ensure the UI only displayed once all data was
              available.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>Authentication and Security</h3>
            <p>Implementing secure user authentication was critical. I used JWT tokens for securing API endpoints and
              ensured sensitive data, like user passwords, was properly hashed. Additionally, CORS was implemented to
              prevent unauthorized access from other domains.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>Optimizing Performance</h3>
            <p>To improve the application's performance, I optimized the React components and reduced the number of
              unnecessary re-renders.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <div class="info-cards">
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>What went well?</h3>
            <p>The myFlix project was a comprehensive learning experience that allowed me to gain deep insights into
              full-stack development using the MERN stack. I learned how to create and set up a back-end and how to
              built
              a
              non-relational database which was all completely novel to me. With React, I discovered an exciting world
              of
              advanced JavaScript UI libraries and component-based architecture and this approach came across as very
              logical, neat, and efficient.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>What didn't go well?</h3>
            <p>My biggest issues were stemming from managing my learning curve, project requirements, and time. If I had
              to
              start over, I'd give myself more time at the beginning to play around with different concepts and breaking
              the
              solution down into even smaller chunks which likely would have cost me more time initially but streamline
              my
              development process further down the road with better organisation and understanding.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="info-cards__item cs-info-border">
            <h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
            <p>The app deserves some additional features such as information about actors, filtering/displaying featured
              movies, movie ratings and commentary, showing similar movies, movie trailers, and 3rd-party login such as
              Google OAuth.
